Jpsonic
========

What is Jpsonic?
-----------------

Jpsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music.

Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work.

Based on Java technology, Jpsonic runs on most platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix variants.

Jpsonic is an [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic) Clone.

Features
-----------------

 - Jpsonic has changed the context and data area so that it does not interfere with Subsonic or Arisonic and even simultaneous operation is possible.
 - The default language is set to JP so as to be intimate with Japanese people, but you can use other languages depending on your choice.
 - Available tags have been expanded. Supports generic tags.

### index

Many character types such as alphabet / hiragana / katakana / kanji / symbols are used in Japanese.
Jpsonic correctly classifies them and creates a Japanese index.
It is a very general and easy-to-understand index for Japanese people, just like Japanese dictionaries, bank branch names, telephone directories and karaoke indexes.

### sort

 - Advanced sorting is available with options. (Albums of artists starting with "various" are not sorted by year / sorted considering serial numbers)
 - Sort by name is expanded to allow for Japanese character string sorting.
 - Even with a variety of character types, Japanese people can use it without feeling uncomfortable.

These are solved by two ways of the server's Japanese analysis function and tag reading.
Therefore, not only can you handle files using CDDB perfectly.
It is also possible to mix it with "old format files" or "raw Japanese name files / directories that are not tag edited".

### search

In addition to regular Japanese phrase search, artists can also use phonetic search and forward match.

Generally, Japanese people unconsciously input 'Reading' and then convert them into appropriate character types by IME conversion.
Jpsonic enables searching during Japanese translation.


History
-----

The original *[Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/)* is developed by [Sindre Mehus](mailto:sindre@activeobjects.no). *Subsonic* was open source through version 6.0-beta1, and closed-source from then onwards.

*Libresonic* was created and maintained by [Eugene E. Kashpureff Jr](mailto:eugene@kashpureff.org). It originated as an unofficial("Kang") of Subsonic which did not contain the Licensing code checks present in the official builds. With the announcement of Subsonic's closed-source future, a decision was made to make a full fork and rebrand to Libresonic.

Around July 2017, it was discovered that Eugene had different intentions/goals for the project than some contributors had. 
*Airsonic* was created in order to provide a full-featured, stable, self-hosted media server based on the Subsonic codebase that is free, open source, and community driven.

Around July 2018, *Jpsonic* was created in order to strengthen browsing and searching in Japanese which is a weak point since *Subsonic*.

In Japan, Subsonic is famous but Airsonic is not well known yet.
Many Japanese will notice more about Airsonic, which has excellent engineers and a wonderful community.

Cherry Blossoms
-----

The Japanese loved cherry blossoms for hundreds of years.

Please ask the Japanese people "What is a flower?".

The Japanese will answer "Sakura".

During international exchange, Japan frequently plants cherry blossoms to show respect for partners.
