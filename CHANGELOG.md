## v106.1.1
#### Based on *airsonic 10.5.0-RELEASE*

  * [fix] Update Tomcat to 8.5.50 (CVE-2019-12418, CVE-2019-17563).

Critical security fix.
The following measures taken.

 - Update Tomcat version to 8.5.50. The only version that addresses threats now.
 - Stop Tomcat precompiler. Because it depends on 8.5.40. As a result, the initial display of the web screen is slightly slower.
 - Jetty will continue to change to a compilable configuration. However,
   since it does not respond to threats, no official distribution will be made.
   It only supports arbitrary compilation.
